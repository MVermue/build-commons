<!--
    This build file contains common targets for handling revision control
    system tasks.

    General markup guidelines:
      - Targets starting with "-" are protected and should never be called
        directly.
      - Targets starting with "~" are hooks that can be overwritten to custom
        functionality.

      - Properties names containing "-" are parameters and they should be
        supplied by using ant's <param /> tag.
      - Properties names containing "." are global properties that are defined
        in a *.properties file or in a build file.
